## Population Distribution and Planning Strategy in Beijing Based on Signaling Data
### Description:
This study combines signaling data analysis, Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, time series analysis, and machine learning techniques to explore urban population distribution and movement patterns, providing comprehensive suggestions for urban planning and development. The research reveals the spatial distribution of the population and its temporal movement patterns, offering innovative solutions to optimize urban structure, improve residents' quality of life, and promote sustainable urban development.
#### 1. Problem 1: Urban Population Distribution Visualization Using GIS
Using ArcGIS software, I conducted spatial analysis of signaling data to visualize urban population distribution and density. Heatmaps and density maps were created, highlighting densely populated and sparsely populated areas, providing fundamental spatial distribution information for urban planning.
#### 2. Problem 2: Commuting Pattern Classification Using K-means Clustering
I preprocessed the signaling data and used Python web scraping to collect POI (Points of Interest) data to classify user activity areas. The K-means clustering algorithm was employed to categorize commuting patterns, effectively identifying commuting behaviors and travel habits of different population groups. Additionally, SARIMAX time series analysis was used to capture the cyclical characteristics of population movement, identifying key commuting routes, peak hours, and tourist hotspots.
#### 3. Problem 3: Spatial Distribution Feature Extraction with GCN
I used Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to model spatial dependency features from the signaling data, with a total of 15 features across 4 categories. The DBSCAN clustering algorithm was applied to extract spatial distribution features, providing essential insights for urban spatial planning and zoning.
#### 4. Problem 4: Practical Urban Development Recommendations
Based on the previous analyses, I proposed practical recommendations for urban development, including population distribution optimization, transportation infrastructure improvements, public service facility adjustments, and commercial facility optimization, aiming to achieve efficient spatial utilization and resource allocation.
#### 5. Problem 5: Sustainable Urban Development Suggestions
Finally, I provided recommendations based on Beijing's historical population data, focusing on infrastructure, environmental sustainability, and transportation, contributing to long-term urban growth strategies.
